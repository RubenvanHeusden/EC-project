Ideas:

Variable population size:
  - Vary the (maximum) size of the population during the simulation
  - Linear decrease?
  - Compare different (static) population sizes on problems with different amounts of local optima?

Comparison between mutation mechanisms and island model in diversity effectiveness

Parent count and new children count in the Recombination process

Replace individuals with less than (95)% fitness of the best individual with random instances?


(Voorlopige) Research Question

Our research question focuses on incorporating Correlated Mutation in an Evolutionary Algorithm as a means of dealing with functions containing a myriad of local optima, 
through maintaining a high degree of diversity within the population. The performance will be compared against an Evolutionary Algorithm using "default" mutation. 
These algorithms will be ran on the Katsuura function to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
algorithm with Correlated Mutation on a problem with many local optima, as well as on "other functions" 
to evaluate whether this algorithm maintains effectiveness on functions with less local optima.
